3 main tools exists :   

* Annovar

* VEP

 [Choice of transcripts and software has a large effect on variant annotation](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm543), so choice in tool or reference annotation can be hard to do. [Here a nice blog providing good insights](https://blog.goldenhelix.com/the-sate-of-variant-annotation-a-comparison-of-annovar-snpeff-and-vep/).  
A new tool entered in the game called [openCRAVAT](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/794297v1). Official doc is [here](https://open-cravat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the github account is [here](https://github.com/KarchinLab/open-cravat).
