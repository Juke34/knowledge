### Anchors
Here is what the code that creates the anchors do:

It downcases the string
remove anything that is not a letter, number, space or hyphen (see the source for how Unicode is handled)
changes any space to a hyphen.
If that is not unique, add "-1", "-2", "-3",... to make it unique

Based on that information you should know how should look your anchor to be recognized.
