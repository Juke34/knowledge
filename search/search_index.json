During my Phd I focused on the analysis and the detection of unitary pseudogenes in eukaryotes. For this purpose, I developed expert system modules that generate and analyse heterogeneous data (e.g phylogenetic trees, protein predictions, sequence ancestral reconstructions, sequence comparisons, parsimony reconstruction of events, etc.). This approach allowing detecting loss and pseudogenization events occurred during evolution and also detecting intact genes not yet annotated (see here and here. I was equally involved in the creation and analysis of phylome of the chordata proteome (see here).  </p> <p>The year after my PhD I was PostDoc at The French National Institute of Higher Education in Agricultural Sciences. My work focused on the detection of positive selection at large scale among angiosperm genomes thanks to an original method. The aim was to study the impact of recurrent gene duplication on adaptation of plant genomes (see here). I also worked on the highlight of the species tree of Triticeae (see here).  </p> <p>I choose to move to Sweden to join NBIS in 2014 as expert in genome annotation. I was performing functional and structural gene annotation in genomes of any type of organisms (e.g. plants, animals, fungi, bacteria) and many other surrounded tasks like genome assembly, transcriptome assembly, abinitio training, manual curation, data submission, cluster administration, etc. A large part of my time was dedicated to the development of tools and pipelines (AGAT, EMBLmyGFF3, GUESSmyLT, etc.). I was also involved in NBIS training activities in Sweden. As part of Elixir I also have teached Genome Annotation and Assembly in different European coutries.  </p> <p>In 2020 I moved back to France in Montpellier to join Alcediag in the CNRS-ALCEDIAG joint research unit. Alcediag is a precision diagnostics company focusing primarily on mental health, which uses epitranscriptomics analysis. We develops and commercialises blood-based diagnostic solutions for mental health. I have been part of the development of EDIT-B/myEDIT-B a diagnostic blood test to differentiate between depression and bipolar disorder.  </p> <p>In 2023 I decided to join the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) still in Montpellier, to be a driving force in the MIVEGEC unit's bioinformatics transition. There I'm part of the bioinformatics platform iTrop and also implied in the Southgreen platform.</p> <p>A along this time I've been involved in a number of interesting projects and communities bioconda, BeeBiome consortium, biostars, nf-core, Nextflow Ambassadors, etc.  </p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/data_visualisation/","title":"Visualisation","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Orange: Data Mining Fruitful and Fun</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Visualization Type Catalogs (from Yuri Engelhardt)</p> <ul> <li>Classic</li> <li>Thorough</li> <li>R</li> <li>Python</li> <li>FT Vocab</li> <li>Searched</li> <li>Tools</li> <li>Weird</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Some blog posts on specific data types (from James Scott-Brown):</p> <ul> <li>Distributions (16 ways)</li> <li>Graphs (6 ways)</li> <li>Two numbers (45 ways)</li> <li>Proportions (9 ways)</li> <li>Change over time (11 ways)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Circular plots</p> <ul> <li>circlize: circular visualization in R</li> <li>circos plots</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>ClustVis a web tool for visualizing clustering of multivariate data</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/taxonomic_classification/","title":"Taxonomic classification","text":"<p>List of tools to perform Taxonomic classification</p> year Name Publication method Reads Contigs branch of life comment kraken x x 2016 Kaiju kmer based x x depend DB used give a txt file, that can be used in KronaChart / Krona tool QIIME2 x ?

It was conceived during a 1997 meeting on computational genefinding at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK and developed in collaboration between the Sanger Centre, the University of California at Santa Cruz and other participants (Holmes I: Studies in Probabilistic Sequence Alignment and Evolution. PhD thesis University of Cambridge 1998.). The key players have been Richard Durbin and David Haussler.  </p> <p>GFF is a one-line-per-record format that can be used to identify a substring of a biological sequence. It is an extension of a basic (name, start, end) tuple (or \"NSE\"). It was originally designed as a common format for sharing information between gene-finding sensors (finding signals: starts, splice sites, stops, motifs; finding regions: exons, introns, protein domains etc.), and gene predictors (predicting gene, RNA transcript or protein structures). These two steps were usually performed within the same program but thanks to the GFF format they can be decoupled, allowing the transfer of feature information from one tool to another. But its uses go beyond gene-finding and it is used as a convenient way to represent a set of many kinds of features. The GFF fomat has been developed to be easy to parse and process by a variety of programs in different languages (e.g Unix tools as grep and sort, perl, awk, etc.). For these reasons, they decided that each feature is described on a single line, and line order is not relevant.</p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/conversion/gxf/#gff","title":"GFF","text":""},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/conversion/gxf/#gff0","title":"GFF0","text":"<p>(before 13-11-1997)  </p> <p>There is no clear information about how the format looked at that time but it was close to the GFF1 format specification without the field <code>source</code> added the 1997-11-13.</p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/conversion/gxf/#gff1","title":"GFF1","text":"<p>(13-11-1997)  </p> <p>For a complete description of the format please refer to this link: https://web.archive.org/web/19980222142332/http://www.sanger.ac.uk:80/~rd/gff.html. This is the oldest description of the format I found (1998-02-22).</p> <p>I consider the format as GFF1 when they definitely defined the 9th field of the format (1997-11-13 rd: added extra <code>source</code> field as discussed at Newton Institute meeting 971029). Before that, the format only existed in its 0th version.</p> <p>This GFF1 format contains 8 mandatory fields followed by one optional field. The fields are:  </p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;feature&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;strand&gt; &lt;frame&gt; [group]\n</code></pre> <p>They are defined as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt;\n    The name of the sequence. Having an explicit sequence name allows a feature file to be prepared for a data set of multiple sequences. Normally the seqname will be the identifier of the sequence in an accompanying fasta format file. An alternative is that 'seqname' is the identifier for a sequence in a public database, such as an EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ accession number. Which is the case, and which file or database to use, should be explained in accompanying information.\n&lt;source&gt;\n    The source of this feature. This field will normally be used to indicate the program making the prediction, or if it comes from public database annotation, or is experimentally verified, etc.\n&lt;feature&gt;\n    The feature type name. We hope to suggest a standard set of features, to facilitate import/export, comparison etc.. Of course, people are free to define new ones as needed. For example, Genie splice detectors account for a region of DNA, and multiple detectors may be available for the same site, as shown above.\n&lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;\n    Integers. &lt;start&gt; must be less than or equal to &lt;end&gt;. Sequence numbering starts at 1, so these numbers should be between 1 and the length of the relevant sequence, inclusive.\n&lt;score&gt;\n    A floating point value. When there is no score (i.e., for a sensor that just records the possible presence of a signal, as \"splice5\" above) you must give something, by convention 0.\n&lt;strand&gt;\n    One of '+', '-' or '.'. '.' should be used when strand is not relevant, e.g. for dinucleotide repeats.\n&lt;frame&gt;\n    One of '0', '1', '2' or '.'. '0' indicates that the specified region is in frame, i.e., that its first base corresponds to the first base of a codon. '1' indicates that there is one extra base, i.e., that the second base of the region corresponds to the first base of a codon, and '2' means that the third base of the region is the first base of a codon. If the strand is '-', then the first base of the region is value of &lt;end&gt;, because the corresponding coding region will run from &lt;end&gt; to &lt;start&gt; on the reverse strand.\n[group]\n    An optional string-valued field that can be used as a name to group together a set of records. Typical uses might be to group the introns and exons in one gene prediction (or experimentally verified gene structure), or to group multiple regions of match to another sequence, such as an EST or a protein. See below for examples.\n\n=&gt; All strings (i.e., values of the &lt;seqname&gt;, &lt;feature&gt; or &lt;group&gt; fields) should be under 256 characters long, and should not include whitespace. The whole line should be under 32k long. A character limit is not very desirable, but helps write parsers in some languages. The slightly silly 32k limit is to allow plenty of space for comments/extra data.\n=&gt; Fields must be separated by TAB characters ('\\t').\n</code></pre> <p>Extra features of the format:</p> <pre><code>Comments\n\nComments are allowed, starting with \"#\" as in Perl, awk etc. Everything following # until the end of the line is ignored. Effectively this can be used in two ways. Either it must be at the beginning of the line (after any whitespace), to make the whole line a comment, or the comment could come after all the required fields on the line.\nWe also permit extra information to be given on the line following the group field without a '#' character. This allows extra method-specific information to be transferred with the line. However, we discourage overuse of this feature: better to find a way to do it with more true feature lines, and perhaps groups.\n\n## comment lines for meta information\n\nThere is a set of standardised (i.e., parsable) ## line types that can be used optionally at the top of a gff file. The philosophy is a little like the special set of %% lines at the top of postscript files, used for example to give the BoundingBox for EPS files.\nCurrent proposed ## lines are:\n\n ##gff-version 1\nGFF version - in case it is a real success and we want to change it. The current version is 1.\n ##source-version {source} {version text}\nSo that people can record what version of a program or package was used to make the data in this file. I suggest the version is text without whitespace. That allows things like 1.3, 4a etc.\n ##date {date}\nThe date the file was made, or perhaps that the prediction programs were run. We suggest to use astronomical format: 1997-11-08 for 8th November 1997, first because these sort properly, and second to avoid any US/European bias.\n\n ##DNA {seqname}\n ##acggctcggattggcgctggatgatagatcagacgac\n ##...\n ##end-DNA\nTo give a DNA sequence. Several people have pointed out that it may be convenient to include the sequence in the file. It should not become mandatory to do so. Often the seqname will be a well-known identifier, and the sequence can easily be retrieved from a database, or an accompanying file.\n ##sequence-region {seqname} {start} {end}\nTo indicate that this file only contains entries for the the specified subregion of a sequence.\nPlease feel free to propose new ## lines. The ## line proposal came out of some discussions including Anders Krogh, David Haussler, people at the Newton Institute on 1997-10-29 and some email from Suzanna Lewis. Of course, naive programs can ignore all of these...\n</code></pre> <p>Here is an example of GFF1:  </p> <pre><code>##gff-version 1\nSEQ1    EMBL    atg 103 105 .   +   0\nSEQ1    EMBL    exon    103 172 .   +   0\nSEQ1    EMBL    splice5 172 173 .   +   .\nSEQ1    netgene splice5 172 173 0.94    +   .\n# this is comment that will be skipped by the parser\nSEQ1    genie   sp5-20  163 182 2.3 +   .\nSEQ1    genie   sp5-10  168 177 2.1 +   .\nSEQ2    grail   ATG 17  19  2.1 -   0\nSEQ3    pred    exon    100 135 .   +   0   locus1 # this is also a comment that will be skipped by the parser\nSEQ3    pred    exon    235 260 .   +   2   locus1 This is an example of extra information...

Fields are:  </p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;feature&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;strand&gt; &lt;frame&gt; [group/attributes] [comments]\n</code></pre> <p>Differences in these fields from GFF1 are as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt;\n    /\n&lt;source&gt;\n    /\n&lt;feature&gt;\n    Version 2 change: Standard Table of Features - we would like to enforce a standard nomenclature for common GFF features. This does not forbid the use of other features, rather, just that if the feature is obviously described in the standard list, that the standard label should be used. For this standard table we propose to fall back on the international public standards for genomic database feature annotation, specifically, the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature table.\n&lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;\n    Version 2 change: version 2 condones values of &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; that extend outside the reference sequence. This is often more natural when dumping from acedb, rather than clipping. It means that some software using the files may need to clip for itself.\n&lt;score&gt;\n    Version 2 change: When there is no score (i.e., for a sensor that just records the possible presence of a signal, as for the EMBL features above) you should use '.' instead of 0.\n&lt;strand&gt;\n    Version 2 change: This field is left empty '.' for RNA and protein features.\n&lt;frame&gt;\n    Version 2 change: This field is left empty '.' for RNA and protein features.\n[group/attribute]\n    [New] Standard Table of Attribute Tag Identifiers The semantics of tags in attribute field tag-values pairs has not yet been completely formalized, however a useful constraint is that they be equivalent, where appropriate, to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature 'qualifiers' of given features (see EMBL feature descriptions).\n\nIn addition to these, ACEDB typically dumps GFF with specific tag-value pairs for given feature types. These tag-value pairs may be considered 'standard' GFF tag-values with respect to ACEDB databases. (rbsk: These will be summarized in a table here in the near future)\n\nVersion 2 change: In version 2, the optional [group] field is renamed to [attribute] (09/99) and must have an tag-value structure following the syntax used within objects in a .ace file, flattened onto one line by semicolon separators. Tags must be standard identifiers ([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*). Free text values must be quoted with double quotes. Note: all non-printing characters in such free text value strings (e.g. newlines, tabs, control characters, etc) must be explicitly represented by their C (UNIX) style backslash-escaped representation (e.g. newlines as '\\n', tabs as '\\t'). As in ACEDB, multiple values can follow a specific tag. The aim is to establish consistent use of particular tags, corresponding to an underlying implied ACEDB model if you want to think that way (but acedb is not required). Examples of these would be:\nseq1     BLASTX  similarity   101  235 87.1 + 0 Target \"HBA_HUMAN\" 11 55 ; E_value 0.0003\ndJ102G20 GD_mRNA coding_exon 7105 7201   .  - 2 Sequence \"dJ102G20.C1.1\"\n\n=&gt; Version 2 change: field and line size limitations are removed; however, fields (except the optional [attribute] field above) must still not include whitespace.\n=&gt; Version 2 note: previous Version 2 permission to use arbitrary whitespace as field delimiters is now revoked! (99/02/26)\n</code></pre> <p>Extra features of the format:</p> <pre><code>Comments\n\n[...]\nWe also permit extra information to be given on the line following the attribute field without a '#' character (Version 2 change: this extra information must be delimited by the '#' comment delimiter OR by another tab field delimiter character, following any and all [attribute] field tag-value pairs).\n[...]\n\nVersion 2 change: we gave in and defined a structured way of passing additional information, as described above under [attribute]. But the sentiment of this paragraph still applies - don't overuse the tag-value syntax. The use of tag-value pairs (with whitespace) renders problematic the parsing of Version 1 style comments (following the attribute field, without a '#' character), so in Version 2, such [attribute] trailing comments must either start with the \"#\" as noted above, or with at least one additional tab character. Moreover, '#' characters embedded within quoted text string values of [attribute] tag-values should not be parsed as the beginning of a comment.\n\n## comment lines for meta information\n\nThere is a set of standardised (i.e., parsable) ## line types that can be used optionally at the top of a gff file. The philosophy is a little like the special set of %% lines at the top of postscript files, used for example to give the BoundingBox for EPS files.\nCurrent proposed ## lines are:\n\n  ##gff-version 2\n    The current version is 2.

If the name is not provided, then all the features in the file are of the given type. Thus, with this meta-comment, a single file could contain DNA, RNA and Protein features, for example, representing a single genomic locus or 'gene', alongside type-specific features of its transcribed mRNA and translated protein sequences.

The ID attribute is required for features that have children (e.g. gene and mRNAs), or for those that span multiple lines, but are optional for other features. IDs for each feature must be unique within the scope of the GFF file. In the case of discontinuous features (i.e., a single feature that exists over multiple genomic locations) the same ID may appear on multiple lines.

The \u201cCDS\u201d feature represents the coding sequence starting with the first translated codon and proceeding to the last translated codon. Unlike Genbank annotation, the stop codon is not included in the \u201cCDS\u201d feature for the terminal exon. The \u201cexon\u201d feature is used to annotate all exons, including non-coding exons. The \u201cstart_codon\u201d and \u201cstop_codon\u201d features should have a total length of three for any transcript but may be split onto more than one line in the rare case where an intron falls inside the codon.\n&lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;\n    Integer start and end coordinates of the feature relative to the beginning of the sequence named in &lt;seqname&gt;. &lt;start&gt; must be less than or equal to &lt;end&gt;.

Note that the frame is not the length of the CDS mod 3. If the strand is '-', then the first base of the region is value of &lt;end&gt;, because the corresponding coding region will run from &lt;end&gt; to &lt;start&gt; on the reverse strand.\n&lt;attributes&gt;\n    Each attribute in the &lt;attribute&gt; field should have the form: attribute_name \u201cattribute_value\u201d;\n    Attributes must end in a semicolon which must then be separated from the start of any subsequent attribute by exactly one space character (NOT a tab character).

Looking at the Human June 2002 assembly, the annotations for Ensembl, Twinscan, SGP, and Geneid appear to exclude the stop codon in the coding region coordinates. All of the other gene annotation sets include the stop codon as part of the coding region. My guess is that this inconsistency is the result of the gene sets being imported from different file formats. The GTF2 format does not include the stop codon in the terminal exon, while the GenBank format does, and the GFF format does not specify what to do.</p> <p>Answer:  </p> <p>Your guess is correct. We haven't gotten around to fixing this situation. A while ago, the Twinscan group made a GTF validator. It interpreted the stop codon as not part of the coding region. Prior to that, all GFF and GTF annotations that we received did include the stop codon as part of the coding region; therefore, we didn't have special code in our database to enforce it. In response to the validator, Ensembl, SGP and Geneid switched their handling of stop codons to the way that Twinscan does it, hence the discrepancy.</p> <p>Inconsistency in GTF format (reported by Evan Keibler in his Masters Project Report):  </p> <p>Although the GTF file format is a fairly simple and well defined format, data is often claimed to be in GTF format when it does not comply completely with the specification. Most data is generated in some proprietary format specific to the particular program or lab which produced it. These proprietary formats often differ in small subtle ways, such as the sequence being indexed starting at position 0 or 1, or the start/stop codon being inside or outside of the initial/terminal exon. If the data is to be effectively shared with others it must be in a standard, well defined format. Though many labs do convert their data to GTF format, the files they generate rarely comply completely with the specification. For this reason the GTF validator was created. The validator allows the user to verify that the data is in correct GTF format before sharing with others. This makes communication more efficient because the receiver does not have to locate and fix the subtle differences between the many file formats.</p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/conversion/gxf/#ensembl-gtf-formats","title":"Ensembl GTF formats","text":""},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/conversion/gxf/#evolution-of-the-3rd-and-9th-column","title":"Evolution of the 3rd and 9th column","text":"<p>Here the example of the human annotation: </p> annotation file ensembl version nb feature type (3rd column) nb attribute tag (9th column) Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.43.gtf 43 4: CDSexonstart_codonstop_codon 6: exon_numbergene_idgene_nameprotein_idtranscript_idtranscript_name Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.74.gtf 74 4: CDSexonstart_codonstop_codon 8: exon_idexon_numbergene_biotypegene_idgene_nameprotein_idtranscript_idtranscript_name Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf 75 8: CDSSelenocysteineUTRexongenestart_codonstop_codontranscript 12: ccds_idexon_idexon_numbergene_biotypegene_idgene_namegene_sourceprotein_idtag<sup>*</sup>transcript_idtranscript_nametranscript_source Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.81.gtf 81 8: CDSSelenocysteineUTRexongenestart_codonstop_codontranscript 22: ccds_idexon_idexon_numberexon_versiongene_biotypegene_idgene_namegene_sourcegene_versionhavana_genehavana_gene_versionhavana_transcripthavana_transcript_versionprotein_idprotein_versiontag<sup>*</sup>transcript_biotypetranscript_idtranscript_nametranscript_sourcetranscript_support_leveltranscript_version Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.82.gtf 82 9: CDSSelenocysteineexonfive_prime_utrgenestart_codonstop_codonthree_prime_utrtranscript 22: same as before Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.gtf 95 9: CDSSelenocysteineexonfive_prime_utrgenestart_codonstop_codonthree_prime_utrtranscript 18: ccds_idexon_idexon_numberexon_versiongene_biotypegene_idgene_namegene_sourcegene_versionprotein_idprotein_versiontag<sup>*</sup>transcript_biotypetranscript_idtranscript_nametranscript_sourcetranscript_support_leveltranscript_version <sup>*</sup>Tags are additional flags used to indicate attibutes of the transcript."},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/conversion/gxf/#difference-between-gencode-and-ensembl-gtf","title":"Difference between GENCODE and Ensembl GTF","text":"<p>From here.  </p> <p>The gene annotation is the same in both files.

PhD thesis University of Cambridge 1998.). The key players have been Richard Durbin and David Haussler.  </p> <p>GFF is a one-line-per-record format that can be used to identify a substring of a biological sequence. It is an extension of a basic (name, start, end) tuple (or \"NSE\"). It was originally designed as a common format for sharing information between gene-finding sensors (finding signals: starts, splice sites, stops, motifs; finding regions: exons, introns, protein domains etc.), and gene predictors (predicting gene, RNA transcript or protein structures). These two steps were usually performed within the same program but thanks to the GFF format they can be decoupled, allowing the transfer of feature information from one tool to another. But its uses go beyond gene-finding and it is used as a convenient way to represent a set of many kinds of features. The GFF fomat has been developed to be easy to parse and process by a variety of programs in different languages (e.g Unix tools as grep and sort, perl, awk, etc.). For these reasons, they decided that each feature is described on a single line, and line order is not relevant.</p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#gff","title":"GFF","text":""},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#gff0","title":"GFF0","text":"<p>(before 13-11-1997)  </p> <p>There is no clear information about how the format looked at that time but it was close to the GFF1 format specification without the field <code>source</code> added the 1997-11-13.</p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#gff1","title":"GFF1","text":"<p>(13-11-1997)  </p> <p>For a complete description of the format please refer to this link: https://web.archive.org/web/19980222142332/http://www.sanger.ac.uk:80/~rd/gff.html. This is the oldest description of the format I found (1998-02-22).</p> <p>I consider the format as GFF1 when they definitely defined the 9th field of the format (1997-11-13 rd: added extra <code>source</code> field as discussed at Newton Institute meeting 971029). Before that, the format only existed in its 0th version.</p> <p>This GFF1 format contains 8 mandatory fields followed by one optional field. The fields are:  </p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;feature&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;strand&gt; &lt;frame&gt; [group]\n</code></pre> <p>They are defined as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt;\n    The name of the sequence. Having an explicit sequence name allows a feature file to be prepared for a data set of multiple sequences. Normally the seqname will be the identifier of the sequence in an accompanying fasta format file. An alternative is that 'seqname' is the identifier for a sequence in a public database, such as an EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ accession number. Which is the case, and which file or database to use, should be explained in accompanying information.\n&lt;source&gt;\n    The source of this feature. This field will normally be used to indicate the program making the prediction, or if it comes from public database annotation, or is experimentally verified, etc.\n&lt;feature&gt;\n    The feature type name. We hope to suggest a standard set of features, to facilitate import/export, comparison etc.. Of course, people are free to define new ones as needed. For example, Genie splice detectors account for a region of DNA, and multiple detectors may be available for the same site, as shown above.\n&lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;\n    Integers. &lt;start&gt; must be less than or equal to &lt;end&gt;. Sequence numbering starts at 1, so these numbers should be between 1 and the length of the relevant sequence, inclusive.\n&lt;score&gt;\n    A floating point value. When there is no score (i.e., for a sensor that just records the possible presence of a signal, as \"splice5\" above) you must give something, by convention 0.\n&lt;strand&gt;\n    One of '+', '-' or '.'. '.' should be used when strand is not relevant, e.g. for dinucleotide repeats.\n&lt;frame&gt;\n    One of '0', '1', '2' or '.'. '0' indicates that the specified region is in frame, i.e., that its first base corresponds to the first base of a codon. '1' indicates that there is one extra base, i.e., that the second base of the region corresponds to the first base of a codon, and '2' means that the third base of the region is the first base of a codon. If the strand is '-', then the first base of the region is value of &lt;end&gt;, because the corresponding coding region will run from &lt;end&gt; to &lt;start&gt; on the reverse strand.\n[group]\n    An optional string-valued field that can be used as a name to group together a set of records. Typical uses might be to group the introns and exons in one gene prediction (or experimentally verified gene structure), or to group multiple regions of match to another sequence, such as an EST or a protein. See below for examples.\n\n=&gt; All strings (i.e., values of the &lt;seqname&gt;, &lt;feature&gt; or &lt;group&gt; fields) should be under 256 characters long, and should not include whitespace. The whole line should be under 32k long. A character limit is not very desirable, but helps write parsers in some languages. The slightly silly 32k limit is to allow plenty of space for comments/extra data.\n=&gt; Fields must be separated by TAB characters ('\\t').\n</code></pre> <p>Extra features of the format:</p> <pre><code>Comments\n\nComments are allowed, starting with \"#\" as in Perl, awk etc. Everything following # until the end of the line is ignored. Effectively this can be used in two ways. Either it must be at the beginning of the line (after any whitespace), to make the whole line a comment, or the comment could come after all the required fields on the line.\nWe also permit extra information to be given on the line following the group field without a '#' character. This allows extra method-specific information to be transferred with the line. However, we discourage overuse of this feature: better to find a way to do it with more true feature lines, and perhaps groups.\n\n## comment lines for meta information\n\nThere is a set of standardised (i.e., parsable) ## line types that can be used optionally at the top of a gff file. The philosophy is a little like the special set of %% lines at the top of postscript files, used for example to give the BoundingBox for EPS files.\nCurrent proposed ## lines are:\n\n ##gff-version 1\nGFF version - in case it is a real success and we want to change it. The current version is 1.\n ##source-version {source} {version text}\nSo that people can record what version of a program or package was used to make the data in this file. I suggest the version is text without whitespace. That allows things like 1.3, 4a etc.\n ##date {date}\nThe date the file was made, or perhaps that the prediction programs were run. We suggest to use astronomical format: 1997-11-08 for 8th November 1997, first because these sort properly, and second to avoid any US/European bias.\n\n ##DNA {seqname}\n ##acggctcggattggcgctggatgatagatcagacgac\n ##...\n ##end-DNA\nTo give a DNA sequence. Several people have pointed out that it may be convenient to include the sequence in the file. It should not become mandatory to do so.

Version 2 also allows '.' as a score, for features for which there is no score. With the changes taking place to version 2 of the format, we also allow for feature sets to be defined over RNA and Protein sequences, as well as genomic DNA. This is used for example by the EMBOSS project to provide standard format output for all features as an option. In this case the  and  fields should be set to '.'. To assist this transition in specification, a new #Type Meta-Comment has been added."},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>This GFF2 format contains 8 mandatory fields followed by optional fields. Fields are:  </p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;feature&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;strand&gt; &lt;frame&gt; [group/attributes] [comments]\n</code></pre> <p>Differences in these fields from GFF1 are as follows:</p> <pre><code>&lt;seqname&gt;\n    /\n&lt;source&gt;\n    /\n&lt;feature&gt;\n    Version 2 change: Standard Table of Features - we would like to enforce a standard nomenclature for common GFF features. This does not forbid the use of other features, rather, just that if the feature is obviously described in the standard list, that the standard label should be used. For this standard table we propose to fall back on the international public standards for genomic database feature annotation, specifically, the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature table.\n&lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;\n    Version 2 change: version 2 condones values of &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; that extend outside the reference sequence. This is often more natural when dumping from acedb, rather than clipping. It means that some software using the files may need to clip for itself.\n&lt;score&gt;\n    Version 2 change: When there is no score (i.e., for a sensor that just records the possible presence of a signal, as for the EMBL features above) you should use '.' instead of 0.\n&lt;strand&gt;\n    Version 2 change: This field is left empty '.' for RNA and protein features.\n&lt;frame&gt;\n    Version 2 change: This field is left empty '.' for RNA and protein features.\n[group/attribute]\n    [New] Standard Table of Attribute Tag Identifiers The semantics of tags in attribute field tag-values pairs has not yet been completely formalized, however a useful constraint is that they be equivalent, where appropriate, to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature 'qualifiers' of given features (see EMBL feature descriptions).\n\nIn addition to these, ACEDB typically dumps GFF with specific tag-value pairs for given feature types. These tag-value pairs may be considered 'standard' GFF tag-values with respect to ACEDB databases. (rbsk: These will be summarized in a table here in the near future)\n\nVersion 2 change: In version 2, the optional [group] field is renamed to [attribute] (09/99) and must have an tag-value structure following the syntax used within objects in a .ace file, flattened onto one line by semicolon separators. Tags must be standard identifiers ([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*). Free text values must be quoted with double quotes. Note: all non-printing characters in such free text value strings (e.g. newlines, tabs, control characters, etc) must be explicitly represented by their C (UNIX) style backslash-escaped representation (e.g. newlines as '\\n', tabs as '\\t'). As in ACEDB, multiple values can follow a specific tag. The aim is to establish consistent use of particular tags, corresponding to an underlying implied ACEDB model if you want to think that way (but acedb is not required). Examples of these would be:\nseq1     BLASTX  similarity   101  235 87.1 + 0 Target \"HBA_HUMAN\" 11 55 ; E_value 0.0003\ndJ102G20 GD_mRNA coding_exon 7105 7201   .  - 2 Sequence \"dJ102G20.C1.1\"\n\n=&gt; Version 2 change: field and line size limitations are removed; however, fields (except the optional [attribute] field above) must still not include whitespace.\n=&gt; Version 2 note: previous Version 2 permission to use arbitrary whitespace as field delimiters is now revoked! (99/02/26)\n</code></pre> <p>Extra features of the format:</p> <pre><code>Comments\n\n[...]\nWe also permit extra information to be given on the line following the attribute field without a '#' character (Version 2 change: this extra information must be delimited by the '#' comment delimiter OR by another tab field delimiter character, following any and all [attribute] field tag-value pairs).\n[...]\n\nVersion 2 change: we gave in and defined a structured way of passing additional information, as described above under [attribute]. But the sentiment of this paragraph still applies - don't overuse the tag-value syntax. The use of tag-value pairs (with whitespace) renders problematic the parsing of Version 1 style comments (following the attribute field, without a '#' character), so in Version 2, such [attribute] trailing comments must either start with the \"#\" as noted above, or with at least one additional tab character. Moreover, '#' characters embedded within quoted text string values of [attribute] tag-values should not be parsed as the beginning of a comment.\n\n## comment lines for meta information\n\nThere is a set of standardised (i.e., parsable) ## line types that can be used optionally at the top of a gff file. The philosophy is a little like the special set of %% lines at the top of postscript files, used for example to give the BoundingBox for EPS files.\nCurrent proposed ## lines are:\n\n  ##gff-version 2\n    The current version is 2. (Version 2 change!)\n ##source-version {source} {version text}\n    /\n ##date {date}\n    /\n  ##Type &lt;type&gt; [&lt;name&gt;]\n    [New] The type of host sequence described by the features. Standard types are 'DNA', 'Protein' and 'RNA'. The optional &lt;name&gt; allows multiple ##Type definitions describing multiple GFF sets in one file, each which have a distinct type. If the name is not provided, then all the features in the file are of the given type. Thus, with this meta-comment, a single file could contain DNA, RNA and Protein features, for example, representing a single genomic locus or 'gene', alongside type-specific features of its transcribed mRNA and translated protein sequences. If no ##Type meta-comment is provided for a given GFF file, then the type is assumed to be DNA.\n\n ##DNA {seqname}\n ##acggctcggattggcgctggatgatagatcagacgac\n ##...\n ##end-DNA\n    /\n\n ##RNA &lt;seqname&gt;\n ##acggcucggauuggcgcuggaugauagaucagacgac\n ##...\n ##end-RNA\n    Similar to DNA.

The ID attribute is required for features that have children (e.g. gene and mRNAs), or for those that span multiple lines, but are optional for other features. IDs for each feature must be unique within the scope of the GFF file. In the case of discontinuous features (i.e., a single feature that exists over multiple genomic locations) the same ID may appear on multiple lines. All lines that share an ID must collectively represent a single feature.   * The reserved Parent attribute can be used to establish a part-of relationship between two features.

The \u201cCDS\u201d feature represents the coding sequence starting with the first translated codon and proceeding to the last translated codon. Unlike Genbank annotation, the stop codon is not included in the \u201cCDS\u201d feature for the terminal exon. The \u201cexon\u201d feature is used to annotate all exons, including non-coding exons. The \u201cstart_codon\u201d and \u201cstop_codon\u201d features should have a total length of three for any transcript but may be split onto more than one line in the rare case where an intron falls inside the codon.\n&lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;\n    Integer start and end coordinates of the feature relative to the beginning of the sequence named in &lt;seqname&gt;. &lt;start&gt; must be less than or equal to &lt;end&gt;.

Note that the frame is not the length of the CDS mod 3.

Looking at the Human June 2002 assembly, the annotations for Ensembl, Twinscan, SGP, and Geneid appear to exclude the stop codon in the coding region coordinates. All of the other gene annotation sets include the stop codon as part of the coding region. My guess is that this inconsistency is the result of the gene sets being imported from different file formats. The GTF2 format does not include the stop codon in the terminal exon, while the GenBank format does, and the GFF format does not specify what to do.</p> <p>Answer:  </p> <p>Your guess is correct. We haven't gotten around to fixing this situation. A while ago, the Twinscan group made a GTF validator. It interpreted the stop codon as not part of the coding region. Prior to that, all GFF and GTF annotations that we received did include the stop codon as part of the coding region; therefore, we didn't have special code in our database to enforce it. In response to the validator, Ensembl, SGP and Geneid switched their handling of stop codons to the way that Twinscan does it, hence the discrepancy.</p> <p>Inconsistency in GTF format (reported by Evan Keibler in his Masters Project Report):  </p> <p>Although the GTF file format is a fairly simple and well defined format, data is often claimed to be in GTF format when it does not comply completely with the specification. Most data is generated in some proprietary format specific to the particular program or lab which produced it. These proprietary formats often differ in small subtle ways, such as the sequence being indexed starting at position 0 or 1, or the start/stop codon being inside or outside of the initial/terminal exon. If the data is to be effectively shared with others it must be in a standard, well defined format. Though many labs do convert their data to GTF format, the files they generate rarely comply completely with the specification. For this reason the GTF validator was created. The validator allows the user to verify that the data is in correct GTF format before sharing with others. This makes communication more efficient because the receiver does not have to locate and fix the subtle differences between the many file formats.</p>"},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#ensembl-gtf-formats","title":"Ensembl GTF formats","text":""},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#evolution-of-the-3rd-and-9th-column","title":"Evolution of the 3rd and 9th column","text":"<p>Here the example of the human annotation: </p> annotation file ensembl version nb feature type (3rd column) nb attribute tag (9th column) Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.43.gtf 43 4: CDSexonstart_codonstop_codon 6: exon_numbergene_idgene_nameprotein_idtranscript_idtranscript_name Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.74.gtf 74 4: CDSexonstart_codonstop_codon 8: exon_idexon_numbergene_biotypegene_idgene_nameprotein_idtranscript_idtranscript_name Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf 75 8: CDSSelenocysteineUTRexongenestart_codonstop_codontranscript 12: ccds_idexon_idexon_numbergene_biotypegene_idgene_namegene_sourceprotein_idtag<sup>*</sup>transcript_idtranscript_nametranscript_source Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.81.gtf 81 8: CDSSelenocysteineUTRexongenestart_codonstop_codontranscript 22: ccds_idexon_idexon_numberexon_versiongene_biotypegene_idgene_namegene_sourcegene_versionhavana_genehavana_gene_versionhavana_transcripthavana_transcript_versionprotein_idprotein_versiontag<sup>*</sup>transcript_biotypetranscript_idtranscript_nametranscript_sourcetranscript_support_leveltranscript_version Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.82.gtf 82 9: CDSSelenocysteineexonfive_prime_utrgenestart_codonstop_codonthree_prime_utrtranscript 22: same as before Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.gtf 95 9: CDSSelenocysteineexonfive_prime_utrgenestart_codonstop_codonthree_prime_utrtranscript 18: ccds_idexon_idexon_numberexon_versiongene_biotypegene_idgene_namegene_sourcegene_versionprotein_idprotein_versiontag<sup>*</sup>transcript_biotypetranscript_idtranscript_nametranscript_sourcetranscript_support_leveltranscript_version <sup>*</sup>Tags are additional flags used to indicate attibutes of the transcript."},{"location":"bioinformatics/format/specification/gxf/#difference-between-gencode-and-ensembl-gtf","title":"Difference between GENCODE and Ensembl GTF","text":"<p>From here.  </p> <p>The gene annotation is the same in both files.
