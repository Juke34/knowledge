## Forewords:

CIGAR is an acronym for **C**oncise **I**diosyncratic **G**apped **A**lignment **R**eport and has been originally defined by the **Exonerate** alignment program. 
The CIGAR format is designed to contain the minimal information necessary for the reconstruction of an alignment. One alignment is described per line, to allow easy manipulation with UNIX tools.**Exonerate CIGAR format does not include nucleotides**.  

It exists other related format:    
  - [**Sugar**](sugar.md) - Simple Ungapped Alignment Report  
  - [**Vulgar**](vulgar.md) - Verbose Ugly Labelled Gapped Alignment Report  
 
**What means idiosyncratic ?**  
  An idiosyncrasy is an unusual feature of the tool (though there are also other uses). It also means odd habit. The term is often used to express eccentricity or peculiarity.
Below is the idiodyncracies/conventions describefd in the man page of exonerate-1.0.0:


    CONVENTIONS
       A  number  of conventions (and idiosyncracies) are used within exonerate.  An understanding of them facili-
       tates interpretation of the output.

       Coordinates
              An in-between coordinate system is used, where the positions are counted between the symbols, rather
              than on the symbols.  This numbering scheme starts from zero.  This numbering is shown below for the
              sequence "ACGT":

               A C G T
              0 1 2 3 4

              Hence the subsequence "CG" would have start=1, end=3, and length=2.  This coordinate system is  used
              internally  in  exonerate,  and for all the output formats produced with the exception of the "human
              readable" alignment display and the GFF output where convention and standards dictate otherwise.

       Reverse Complements
              When an alignment is reported on the reverse complement of a sequence, the  coordinates  are  simply
              given  on  the  reverse complement copy of the sequence.  Hence positions on the sequences are never
              negative.  Generally, the forward strand is indicated by '+', the reverse  strand  by  '-',  and  an
              unknown or not-applicable strand (as in the case of a protein sequence) is indicated by '.'

       Alignment Scores
              Currently,  only  the raw alignment scores are displayed.  This score just is the sum of transistion
              scores used in the dynamic programming.  For example, in the case  of  a  Smith-Waterman  alignment,
              this will be the sum of the substitution matrix scores and the gap penalties.

## Evolution of the CIGAR string

### Original Exonerate CIGAR (From 2001)

We cannot talk about the CIGAR format without talking first about the [**SUGAR** format](sugar.md). Sugar is Simple UnGapped Alignment Report, which displays ungapped alignments one-per-line. The sugar line starts with the string "sugar:" for easy extraction from the output, and is followed by the following 9 fields in the order below:

>1. query identifier  
>2. query start position  
>3. query stop position  
>4. query strand  
>5. target identifier  
>6. target start position  
>7. target stop position  
>8. target strand  
>9. score 

Here an example of SUGAR format:  
`sugar: hs989235.cds 5 468 + hsnfg9.embl 25689 27450 + 1916`

The **CIGAR** format starts  with  the same 9 fields as SUGAR output (see above), and is followed by a series of <operation, length> pairs where operation is one of **match**, **insert** or **delete**, and the length describes the number of times this operation is repeated
Cigar format looks like this:

`cigar: hs989235.cds 15 459 - hsnfg9.embl 25698 27440 - 1820.20 M 22 D 1 M 12 D 1 M 16 N 898 M 12 D 1 M 164 I 1 M 37 N 404 M 133 D 1 M 4 D 1 M 39`

The 10th field is actually the **CIGAR string** and are defined in pairs. Each pair is also called a run. The cigar string describes the edit path throught the alignment. These contain a M,I and D corresponding to a Match, Insert and Delete, followed by the length.

**/!\ the N operator:**    
The ensembl documentation from 13 November 2001 says about the exonerate's operators: `These contain a M,I,D or N corresponding to a Match, Insert, Delete or iNtron, followed by the length.`  
Delete and intron are finaly a similar concept and I have rarely meet a N operator except in the CIGAR example above ([from ensembl Wiki November 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20020717044729/http://www.ensembl.org:80/Docs/wiki/html/EnsemblDocs/CigarFormat.html)). In the first exonerate documentation I found (0.7.0 with a man page from November 2002) - I didn't succed to retrieve information about the first version (0.3d) of exonerate that has been mentioned in Nature december 2001 (https://doi.org/10.1038/414865a)) they do not talk about the intron (N) operator. So, we could imagine that N was initially present and has been then removed before November 2002 from exonerate but kept in a not updadted documentation of Ensembl.

Operator | Description
-- | --
M    |    **M**atch
I     |   **I**nsert
D    |   **D**elete

To resume:  
Each pair/run is encoded by the letter code/operator, whitespace, and the length; multiple pairs/runs are separated by whitespace.

## Ensembl CIGAR
Then Ensembl has created the **ensembl cigar format**.

In the Ensembl CIGAR format the numbers and letters are switched, and there are no gaps in the string. So the above example in Ensembl would appear in a feature table in three rows with these CIGAR strings:

>13M1I35M1I4M1I13M1D4M1I115M  
>37M1D164M1I12M  
>16M1I12M1I21M1D10M

/!\ What about N for i**N**tron ?
The ensembl page describe the CIGAR string from exonerate like that:  
`The cigar string describes the edit path throught the alignment. These contain a M,I,D or N corresponding to a Match, Insert, Delete or iNtron, followed by the length.`
I don't know where that N is coming from, I havn't find any ressource using/talking about the N (iNtron) operator. It seems to be used by D systemtically. Any information about it is very welcome.

## 1st Update of the Exonerate CIGAR string - Gap attribute in GFF3(2004)

The GFF3 format integrated a Gap attribute in the 9th column of the gff" files to describe alignements. [Here is a full description.](https://web.archive.org/web/20040804181956/http://song.sourceforge.net:80/gff3.shtml)  

Here the essentail we have to retain:

    Gap   The alignment of the feature to the target if the two are
          not colinear (e.g. contain gaps).  The alignment format is
	  taken from the CIGAR format described in the 
	  Exonerate documentation.http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/exonerate
           ?cvsroot=Ensembl).See "THE GAP ATTRIBUTE" for a description
	   of this format.
	[...]
	THE GAP ATTRIBUTE
	-----------------
	[...]
	GFF3 recommends representing gapped alignments
	explicitly with the "Gap" attribute.  The Gap attribute's format
	consists of a series of (operation,length) pairs separated by "+"
	signs, for example M8+D3+M6.  Each operation is a single-letter code.

Here are the different operators:

Operator/Code | Description/Operation
-- | --
M    |    match
I     |   insert a gap into the reference sequence
D    |   insert a gap into the target (delete from reference)
F     |   frameshift forward in the reference sequence
R     |   frameshift reverse in the reference sequence

Compare to the original CIGAR string there is no more whitespace between the letter code and the length.  

**Here an example of this type of CIGAR string DNA/DNA:**  

        Chr3  (reference)  1 CAAGACCTAAACTGGAT-TCCAAT  23
        EST23 (target)     1 CAAGACCT---CTGGATATCCAAT  21

	In the alignment between EST23 and Chr3 shown above, Chr3 is the
	reference sequence referred to in the first column of the GFF3 file,
	and EST23 is the sequence referred to by the Target attribute.  This
	gives a Gap string of "M8 D3 M6 I1 M6". The full GFF match line will
	read:

	   Chr23 . Match 1 23 . . . ID=Match1;Target=EST23+1+21;Gap=M8+D3+M6+I1+M6

	>Gap=M8+D3+M6+I1+M6

**Here an example of this type of CIGAR string AA/DNA:** 

	For protein to nucleotide matches, the M, I and D operations apply to
	amino acid residues in the target and nucleotide base pairs in the
	reference in a 1:3 residue.  That is, "M2" means to match two amino
	residues in the target to six base pairs in the reference.  Hence this
	alignment:

	 100 atgaaggag---gttattgcgaatgtcggcggt
	   1 M..K..E..V..V..I..-..N..V..G..G..

	Corresponds to this GFF3 Line:

	 ctg123 . nucleotide_to_protein 100 129 . + . ID=match008;Target=p101+1+10;Gap=M3+I1+M2+D1+M4

/!\ They apprarently also mix-up abilities from the **CIGAR** string format and those from the [**VULGAR** string format](vulgar.md). Indeed they added the **F** and **R** operators, and the **F** was by the [VULGAR format](vulgar.md).

Here the explanation about the **F** and **R** operators:  

	In addition, the Gap attribute provides orward and everse
	frameshift operators to allow for frameshifts in the alignment.  These
	are in nucleotide coordinates: a forward frameshift skips forward the
	indicated number of base pairs, while a reverse frameshift moves
	backwards.  Examples:


	 100 atgaaggag---gttattgaatgtcggcggt     Gap=M3+I1+M2+F1+M4
	   1 M..K..E..V..V..I...
				N..V..G..G


	 100 atgaaggag---gttataatgtcggcggt        Gap=M3+I1+M2+R1+M4
	   1 M..K..E..V..V..I.
			      N..V..G..G
			      
## 2nd Update of the Exonerate CIGAR string - Gap attribute in GFF3(2005)

The main difference lies in the replacement of the + character by a space.  

Here the essentail we have to retain:

	THE GAP ATTRIBUTE
	-----------------
	[...]
	GFF3 recommends representing gapped alignments
	explicitly with the "Gap" attribute.  The Gap attribute's format
	consists of a series of (operation,length) pairs separated by spac
	characters, for example "M8 D3 M6".  Each operation is a single-letter code.



**Here an example of this type of CIGAR string DNA/DNA:**  

        Chr3  (reference)  1 CAAGACCTAAACTGGAT-TCCAAT  23
        EST23 (target)     1 CAAGACCT---CTGGATATCCAAT  21

	In the alignment between EST23 and Chr3 shown above, Chr3 is the
	reference sequence referred to in the first column of the GFF3 file,
	and EST23 is the sequence referred to by the Target attribute.  This
	gives a Gap string of "M8 D3 M6 I1 M6". The full GFF match line will
	read:

	   Chr23 . Match 1 23 . . . ID=Match1;Target=EST23 1 21;Gap=M8 D3 M6 I1 M6

	>Gap=M8 D3 M6 I1 M6

**Here an example of this type of CIGAR string AA/DNA:**  

	For protein to nucleotide matches, the M, I and D operations apply to
	amino acid residues in the target and nucleotide base pairs in the
	reference in a 1:3 residue.  That is, "M2" means to match two amino
	residues in the target to six base pairs in the reference.  Hence this
	alignment:

	 100 atgaaggag---gttattgcgaatgtcggcggt
	   1 M..K..E..V..V..I..-..N..V..G..G..

	Corresponds to this GFF3 Line:

	 ctg123 . nucleotide_to_protein 100 129 . + . ID=match008;Target=p101 1 10;Gap=M3 I1 M2 D1 M4

	In addition, the Gap attribute provides <F>orward and <R>everse
	frameshift operators to allow for frameshifts in the alignment.  These
	are in nucleotide coordinates: a forward frameshift skips forward the
	indicated number of base pairs, while a reverse frameshift moves
	backwards.  Examples:


	 100 atgaaggag---gttattgaatgtcggcggt     Gap=M3 I1 M2 F1 M4
	   1 M..K..E..V..V..I...
				N..V..G..G


	 100 atgaaggag---gttataatgtcggcggt        Gap=M3 I1 M2 R1 M4
	   1 M..K..E..V..V..I.
			      N..V..G..G

## 3rd Update of the Exonerate CIGAR string - Gap attribute in GFF3

I don't know when this update occured. 
They decide to mix up the Exonerate specification with the BaseAlignFormat format used by Ensembl. In this specification the numbers and letters are switched, they remove space between pairs and decided that for segments of length 1 the number can be omitted, so "8M1D6M" is equal to "8MD6M". 
[Here the full description.](http://wiki.wormbase.org/index.php/GFF3specProposal)

Here one example of this format:  
> Gap=M3IM2RM4

## 1st Samtools CIGAR specification (~2009)

**SAMtools created the extended cigar string**.
Here is a priori the original specification of the Samtools CIGAR format:

Operator | Description
-- | --
D | Deletion; the nucleotide is present in the reference but not in the read
H | Hard Clipping; the clipped nucleotides are not present in the read.
I | Insertion; the nucleotide is present in the read  but not in the reference.
M | Match; can be either an alignment match or mismatch. The nucleotide is present in the reference.
N | Skipped region; a region of nucleotides is not present in the read
P | Padding; padded area in the read and not in the reference
S | Soft Clipping;  the clipped nucleotides are present in the read

In this variant, whitespace is removed and the order of the letter code and length are reversed (length appears before letter code) compared to the Exonerate CIGAR string.
 So it could looks like that:  
>24M3I7M2D19M

## 2nd Samtools CIGAR (Extended CIGAR)

The “M” didn't allow to differentiate between the matches and mismatches. So, “X” (substitution/Mismatch) and “=”  (match) have been added to the specification in response to the request of several important users (c.f. [The history the MD tag and the CIGAR X operator](http://lh3.github.io/2018/03/27/the-history-the-cigar-x-operator-and-the-md-tag)). 

Here is the current specification of the Samtools CIGAR format:

Operator | Description
-- | --
D | Deletion; the nucleotide is present in the reference but not in the read
H | Hard Clipping; the clipped nucleotides are not present in the read.
I | Insertion; the nucleotide is present in the read  but not in the reference.
M | Match; can be either an alignment match or mismatch. The nucleotide is present in the reference.
N | Skipped region; a region of nucleotides is not present in the read
P | Padding; padded area in the read and not in the reference
S | Soft Clipping;  the clipped nucleotides are present in the read
X | Read Mismatch; the nucleotide is present in the reference
= | Read Match; the nucleotide is present in the reference

So it could looks like that:  
>16=X7=3I7=2DX18=


## In sum

### Quick comparison between the different CIGAR string flavors

Flavor | Year| Operator | Example | Description | 
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Original CIGAR | ~2002 | D,I,M			| M 37 D 1 M 164 I 1 M 12 D 898 M 16 I 1 M 12 I 1 M 21 D 1 M 10 | Series of <operation,whitespace, length> pairs/runs, and the length describes the number of times this operation is repeated. Multiple pairs/runs are separated by whitespace.
 Ensembl CIGAR | 2004 | D,I,M			| 37M1D164M1I12M<br/> 16M1I12M1I21M1D10M | The numbers and letters are switched, and there are no gaps in the string. If there is a gap it will become a new line in the output.
GFF3 CIGAR v1 | 2004 | D,F,I,M,R		| M8+D1+M6 | As the original CIGAR except new operators and no more whitespace between the letter code and the length. Pairs separated by "+" signs
GFF3 CIGAR v2 | 2005 | D,F,I,M,R		| M8 D1 M6 | As the original CIGAR except new operators and no more whitespace between the letter code and the length. Pairs separated by space characters
GFF3 CIGAR v3 | ? |  D,F,I,M,R		| 8MD6M | remove space between pairs and decided that for segments of length 1 the number can be omitted
Samtools CIGAR v1 | 2008 | D,H,I,M,N,P,S	| 24M3I7M2D19M | In this variant, whitespace is removed and the order of the letter code and length are reversed (length appears before letter code) compared to the Exonerate CIGAR string. It looks like GFF3 CIGAR v2, but with more operators.
Samtools CIGAR v2 | July 2009 | D,H,I,M,N,P,S,X,= 	| 16=X7=3I7=2DX18= | Compare to Samtools CIGAR v1, add X and = to differentiate Match (M)

### All CIGAR operators gathered in one table

To gather all the operator information in one place, I did a union of the different operators of the different formats and end-up with this last table:

Operator | Description
-- | --
D | Deletion; the nucleotide is present in the reference but not in the read / insert a gap into the target (delete from reference)
F | Frameshift / frameshift forward in the reference sequence
H | Hard Clipping; the clipped nucleotides are not present in the read
I | Intron / the nucleotide is present in the read  but not in the reference. / insert a gap into the reference sequence
M | Match ; can be either an alignment match or mismatch. The nucleotide is present in the reference.
N | A region of nucleotides is not present in the read
P | Padding; padded area in the read and not in the reference
R     |   frameshift reverse in the reference sequence
S | Soft Clipping;  the clipped nucleotides are present in the read
X | Read Mismatch; the nucleotide is present in the reference
= | Read Match; the nucleotide is present in the reference
